On September 14. For so long I felt like I needed something, like an companion. So I scoll on google and Found a very adorable cat named Jasmine. I decide to went to visit Jasmine, I wasn't expect to just take her home but after seeing her for the first time, I could not hold it and decide to adopt her right on the spot.
