At first I didn't know what I wanted to be, I see multiple Police men driving around my city and think I wanted to become one of them, I like to obey the law and I want to protect everyone around me. But I don't feel like it was meant for me, I decide to choose the career path as a game developer because I enjoy playing video games more than anything, but after two years in college learning the basics of game design, I felt like it wasn't for me. I thought I would enjoy making video games same as playing, but it was too complicated and I wasn't enjoy doing it. So now I switched to Full-Stack-Developer since I really enjoyed making websites, its fun and I can use my imagination to create websites.
