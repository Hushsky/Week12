I love playing Video Games, in fact I've played Video Games for most of my life now. I mostly play PC games such as League of Legends or Valorant plus Steam games. Thanks to these game that I played for most of my life, I was able to gain multiple useful skills in life such as Multitasking, Fast Learner, Fast Thinking and Quick Reflect.
